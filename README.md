Novel Coronavirus Prediction and Visualization using SVM, Bayesian Ridge and Polynomial Regression
This repository tracks the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is a contagious respiratory virus that first started in Wuhan in December 2019. On 2/11/2020, the disease is officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.
Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
this project deals with the time series dataset of novel coronavirus and prediction of number of cases, number of deaths and number of recoveries.
run the pyhton file or the ipynb notebook file for executing the project.
the dataset used in this project is live dataset which keeps on changing daily according to the number of cases confirmed, deaths confirmed, recoveries confirmed by WHO (World Health Organisation) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
